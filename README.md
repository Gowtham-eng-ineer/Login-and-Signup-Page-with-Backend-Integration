## How to Run  

# Prerequisites  
1. Install **Node.js** and **npm** on your system.  
2. Install and run **MongoDB** locally or have access to a MongoDB server.  
3. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repository-url>  
   cd <repository-folder>  
   ```  

# Running the Backend  
1. Navigate to the backend directory if applicable.  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```  
3. Start the server:  
   ```bash  
   node server.js  
   ```  
   By default, the server will run on port `5000`.  

# Connecting the Frontend  
1. Ensure the frontend is configured to send API requests to the backend server (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).  
2. Run the frontend by starting its server or serving the HTML files.
